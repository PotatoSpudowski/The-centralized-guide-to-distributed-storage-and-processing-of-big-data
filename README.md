# hitchhikers-guide-to-distributed-storage-and-processing-of-big-data

![pyspark]()

This is a repository containing my code samples that helped me understand the concepts of distributed storage and processing of Big data using Apache spark and Python.

## Code samples

### 01_counter.py
This script loads the "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" book using pyspark modules 
and finds the count of each word in the book by loading the text file as a RDD(Resilient distributed dataset) and distributing the processing among 3 local clusters.
